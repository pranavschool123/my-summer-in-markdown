# Summer 2024 - Pranav K

## Introduction
My name is Pranav Kunderu, and I am a Junior at Chatsworth Charter High School. Some information about me is that I love to go cycling, play basketball, and do photography. Currently, I am even taking a photography class outside of school! Another thing I like doing is hanging out with my friends and going out. We like to go to the beach, the mall, Dave and Busters, and other smaller places. Finally, I hope to learn and get better at coding through this class!
