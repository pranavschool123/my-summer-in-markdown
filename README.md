# Summer 2024 - Pranav K

## Introduction
My name is Pranav Kunderu, and I am a Junior at Chatsworth Charter High School. Some information about me is that I love to go cycling, play basketball, and do photography. Currently, I am even taking a photography class outside of school! Another thing I like doing is hanging out with my friends and going out. We like to go to the beach, the mall, Dave and Busters, and other smaller places. Finally, I hope to learn and get better at coding through this class!

## Summer Playlist
I listened to various different songs this summer, ranging from rap to hip-hop to even indie! One of my favorite parts of summer was listening to music and working on different things that I needed to get done. Here are some songs that I was listening to:

## Favorite Summer Food
This summer, I really started getting into Chipotle. I won't lie, I have always been fond of Chipotle. However, I previously used to eat it once every few months. Summer completely changed this. I decided to eat Chipotle once the first week of summer. Then, a few days later, I got it again. Then again. By the end of summer, I probably ate Chipotle around 10 times! I really enjoyed it and just know that this fondness for Chipotle will stay with me for the forseeable future. P.S. it is currently the third week of school and I have already had it twice LOL.

## Favorite Summer Memory with Friends
Near the end of this summer, I went to the beach with quite a few of my friends. We decided to go due to the fact that half of them were going to college, and as a goodbye memory, we decided to enjoy ourselves at the beach. We first met up in Santa Monica and walked around the stores and got food (CHIPOTLE). Then, we decided to go to Target and get some snacks for the beach. I got some Nerds Gummy Clusters and all of my friends decided to get different things so that we could share. One of my friends, Nihaan, decided to get gummy worms. Another one of my friends, Shivm, decided to get chips. After we got snacks, we walked to Santa Monica beach and played volleyball for a little bit. Soon after starting, we realized that we were all pretty bad so we decided to just play football instead. However, we stopped playing pretty soon after as well, due to the fact that it is quite hard to run on sand LOL. After, we went closer to the water and just layed in the sand and talked for a while. Intermittently, we would get up and go into the water, but we were just enjoying for the most part. After it started becoming dark, we decided to walk around and get some food. We decided on this ramen place, but honestly I didn't really like it :( . Finally, we all got in our ubers and went home. This was the best memory I have from the summer because I was able to say goodbye to all of my friends leaving to college, and wish them well in their futures!
